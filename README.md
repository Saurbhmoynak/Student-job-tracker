# Student Job Tracker Web App

A fullstack application built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to track job applications for students. The app allows users to add job applications, update statuses, filter by date/status, and delete entries. The project is deployed on **Vercel** (Frontend), **Render** (Backend), and uses **MongoDB Atlas** for data storage.
